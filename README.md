## Branch Structure

```
main   ← production only. Sparkle update feed reads this branch.
dev    ← all development happens here
```

Never develop directly on `main`. All code changes go to `dev` first.

---

## Development

Open the project and build the **Debug** scheme. This runs as **Plink Dev** with a separate data store — completely isolated from the production app.

```bash
# Regenerate .xcodeproj after changing project.yml:
xcodegen generate
```

---

## Releasing a New Version

When `dev` is stable and ready to ship, run from the repo root:

```bash
./ship.sh <version> <build>
# Example:
./ship.sh 1.6 3
```

This will:
1. Verify you're on `dev` with no uncommitted changes
2. Merge `dev` → `main`
3. Build the Release configuration
4. Create and sign the DMG
5. Update `appcast.xml`
6. Push everything to GitHub
7. Switch back to `dev`

Then follow the printed instructions to create the GitHub Release and upload the DMG.

### Build number convention
Always increment the build number with each release. Sparkle uses it (not the version string) to detect updates.

| Version | Build |
|---|---|
| 1.5 | 1 |
| 1.5.1 | 2 |
| 1.6 | 3 |
| … | +1 |

## Localization

Strings are managed in `Plink/Core/Localizable.xcstrings`. Currently supported:
- English (`en`)
- German (`de`)
- Spanish — coming later this year
